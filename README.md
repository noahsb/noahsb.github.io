### Code Highlighting

Since the underlying theme ships with [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) and [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) certain additional features were added to code blocks. You can find an overview / usage example in the [example repository](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/examples/minimal-blog/content/posts/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them/index.mdx)!
